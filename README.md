This is an implementation of the Troika hashing algorithmus on ICE40 FPGAs.

The repository is intended to be used by developers who are considering using Troika in their hardware projects. The board-files are from a PoC which can be used as design example.

It's not a high-performance solution because it needs multiple clock-cycles per hash-round and the implementation is heavily restricted by logic resources and achievable speed of ICE40 FPGAs. But the FPGA is very cheap, the PCB can be done by any cheap chinese manufacturer and soldering is doable with a bit of practice. And it's a lot faster than doing hash calculations only in software if using e.g. auto-padding and/or multi-hash-loops. IOTA library functions can benefit much because 1. it works much with 243Trit vectors and 2. they often do multiple hashing loops (e.g. address generation, signing).

Support for this repository is limited because it's just a PoC and intended for experienced developers. (by the way, it's the same PCB as for the PoWChip PoC - for Troika the GSM/BT/GPS modul is not needed and software for it is not included in the repository).

Some features (FPGA):
- ICE40UP5K ($5 FPGA in QFN package)
- FPGA about 73% utilized
- running at 36MHz (uses internal 48MHz oscillator + PLL; no external oscillator required)
- Data-transfers via SPI
- It needs 55 clock cycles per hash
- It can do auto-padding for 243Trit input size (single Block; in IOTA used a lot)
- It can do multiple loops with auto-padding (this is interesting for e.g. IOTA where often a block has to be hashed multiple times; It reduces transfer-times significantly)
- It supports nested hashing by "push"ing" and "pop"ing the internal Troika state to and from a "Stack" (actually, it's an internal offset for RAM address but it acts like a stack).

PCB:
- ICE40UP5K FPGA
- STM32F302CCTx ÂµC (default DFU Bootloader can be used)
- Pinheader for GSM/GPS/BT module (not used in this application)
- Some LEDs, Buttons
- SWD Debug header

Performance:
- 10k blocks (including SPI transfer times) in 11.6s
- 1k blocks with 27 hash-loops (including SPI transfer times and auto-padding) in 2.6s

This repository contains:
- Radiant project files for ICE40 FPGAs with VHDL source files
- Example Board-Design
- Eclipse project with code for STM32F302

Just a small note ... A synthesized ICE40 Bitstream is included in the STM32-code (bitstream.h)
